# Birthdays

Ever thought that remembering each and every one of your family/friends/acquaintances birthdays is too difficult?

Same, so I'm putting it into a repo.

## Usage

Create a file containing all birthdays you want to store, together with the name of the person, and additional information if necessary.

Query the data through:

1. Search by name: Input a name, and get the stored data and additional info
2. Search by date: Input a date, and get the stored name and additional info

Additionally, terminal will run the script to check if today's date is anyone's birthday, and print the result onto the terminal as a reminder.

## TODO

1. Add the sorting functionality to the database
2. Create the querying function
3. Create bash script for terminal
4. Add your own birthdays to it
